# reWiki 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Suggest One

### Project Description
Our problem provides a wikipedia platform for the most intelligent coders (Level almost imbossible to achieve) which requires us to break multiple layers of secuirity of a chatbot and jailbreak it inorder to make it give us the passkey for the encrypted data we are hoping to get (Many are still hoping to this day). Well all the best for anyone who dares to use this wiki which even the developers find too annoying.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[The problem here is the lack of wikipedia sites which are a challenge to use (Who even complains about that). So we took the matters to our own hands to make the most impossible to use wiki.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The wiki contains all the data you need but the catch is .... are you a jailbreaking pro or not (for educational purposes only). The wiki welcomes you with a chatbot which provides you with all the information you need but can you read gibberish, yes the data is encrypted and needs a passkey to decrypt which can only be obtained by jailbreaking the chatbot....But wait that seems a little too easy why not let the site refresh every five minutes so that you can enjoy this not so useful but fun process every five minutes

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- JavaScript,Python,HTML
- React, Flask, TensorFlow, PyTorch

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
- npm i // Inside the client directory
- pip install -r requirements.txt // inside server directory

# Run
[commands]
npm run dev // Inside the client directory
flask --app server --debug run --port 5000 // Inside the root directory

### Project Documentation
For Software: The webstite is a online encyclopedia which contains a chatbot. Jailbreak the chatbot and make it say a particular keyword which the gives the decrypted format of the content. The webstite refreshes every five minute so we have to decrypt it within 5 minute
